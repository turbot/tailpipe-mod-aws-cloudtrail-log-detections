## Description

This detection identifies traffic mirror targets that are associated with internet-facing Network Load Balancers (NLBs). Traffic mirroring is a powerful tool for network monitoring and troubleshooting, but associating it with an internet-facing NLB can expose mirrored traffic to external threats, potentially leading to data leakage or unauthorized access.

## Risks

Associating a traffic mirror target with an internet-facing NLB introduces significant security risks. Mirrored traffic may include sensitive data, such as unencrypted packets or metadata, that could be exposed to unauthorized entities if accessed through the NLB. This can lead to data breaches, privacy violations, and compromise of critical systems.

In addition to the security risks, such configurations may indicate mismanagement or a lack of adherence to network monitoring best practices. Traffic mirroring should be carefully configured to ensure that mirrored data is directed only to trusted, secure destinations. Regular monitoring of traffic mirror targets and their configurations is essential to maintaining a secure and compliant network environment.
