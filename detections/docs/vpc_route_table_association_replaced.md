## Overview

Detect instances where route table associations have been replaced within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Replacing route table associations can disrupt traffic flow, impact application availability, or expose resources to unintended access. Monitoring these changes ensures network integrity and protects against unauthorized modifications.
