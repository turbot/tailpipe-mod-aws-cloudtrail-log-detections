## Overview

Detect when an AWS Config rule was deleted. Deleting a Config rule disrupts compliance monitoring, potentially leaving non-compliant resources undetected and increasing security and operational risks. Monitoring rule deletions ensures continuous evaluation of resource compliance and maintains a secure cloud environment.
