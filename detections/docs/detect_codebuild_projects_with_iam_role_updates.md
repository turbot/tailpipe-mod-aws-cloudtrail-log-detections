## Overview

Detect updates to IAM roles associated with AWS CodeBuild projects. Unauthorized or unintended role changes can grant excessive permissions, disrupt build processes, or expose sensitive resources. Monitoring IAM role updates ensures permissions align with the principle of least privilege and safeguards the security of build environments.
