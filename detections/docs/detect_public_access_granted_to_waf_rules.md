## Overview

Detect instances where public access is granted to AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules. Publicly accessible WAF rules can expose critical security configurations, allowing unauthorized users to view or modify firewall rules. Monitoring these configurations ensures that WAF rules adhere to the principle of least privilege and protect web applications from unauthorized changes.
