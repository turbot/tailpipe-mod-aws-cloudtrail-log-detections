## Overview

Detect AWS Systems Manager (SSM) documents that are configured to capture unauthorized input from systems or users. Such configurations can be exploited to collect sensitive data, credentials, or system information without proper authorization. Monitoring these SSM documents ensures compliance with security policies and mitigates risks of data leakage or misuse.
