## Overview

Detect when a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network ACL (NACL) rule was updated. Unauthorized or unintended changes to NACLs can introduce security risks, such as exposing resources to external threats or disrupting legitimate traffic. Monitoring NACL updates ensures network security and operational integrity.
