## Overview

Detect when an Amazon EventBridge rule is deleted in a region. Deleting an EventBridge rule can disrupt event-driven workflows, delay processing, or prevent critical actions, potentially impacting application performance and operational continuity. Monitoring for a deleted rule ensures critical workflows are protected from unauthorized changes and accidental disruptions.
