## Overview

Detect changes to the launch permissions of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) in your AWS environment. Modifying launch permissions, especially to share AMIs with external accounts, can expose sensitive configurations or proprietary software to unauthorized use. Monitoring these changes helps prevent unauthorized access and ensures secure AMI management.
