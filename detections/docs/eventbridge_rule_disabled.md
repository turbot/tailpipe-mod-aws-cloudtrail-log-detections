## Overview

Detect when an Amazon EventBridge rule is disabled in a region. Disabling an EventBridge rule can disrupt event delivery, delay automated actions, or prevent critical workflows from executing. This increases the risk of operational inefficiencies and may allow unauthorized activities to go undetected. Monitoring for a disabled rule ensures workflows remain operational and protected.
