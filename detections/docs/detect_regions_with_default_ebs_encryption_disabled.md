## Description

This detection identifies AWS regions where the default encryption setting for Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes is disabled. By default, EBS volumes should be encrypted to ensure that data at rest is protected. Disabling default encryption may lead to unencrypted volumes being created inadvertently, increasing the risk of data exposure.

## Risks

Failing to enable default EBS encryption introduces significant security and compliance risks. Unencrypted EBS volumes can store sensitive data in plaintext, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access if the volume is compromised. This is particularly concerning in environments that handle sensitive workloads, such as personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, or proprietary business information.

In addition to security concerns, leaving default EBS encryption disabled can lead to operational challenges. For instance, managing encryption on a per-volume basis becomes more complex and error-prone, especially in large-scale environments. This increases the likelihood of human error, such as unintentionally creating unencrypted volumes or failing to enforce encryption policies across all resources. These issues can complicate audits and hinder the ability to maintain a consistent security posture.
