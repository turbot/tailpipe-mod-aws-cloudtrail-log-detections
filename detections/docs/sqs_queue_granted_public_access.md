## Overview

Detect when an Amazon SQS queue was granted public access. Public access to SQS queues can allow unauthorized entities to send or receive messages, leading to potential data leakage, service disruption, or unauthorized actions within applications. Monitoring public access grants ensures secure and controlled message processing while protecting sensitive workflows.
