## Description

This detection identifies instances where Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) are copied from external accounts into your AWS environment. Copying AMIs from external sources may introduce unvetted or potentially malicious images into your infrastructure, posing a security risk. Monitoring such activities helps ensure the integrity and security of your EC2 environment.

## Risks

Copying AMIs from external accounts can introduce significant security risks, as these images may contain vulnerabilities, malicious software, or misconfigurations. Using untrusted AMIs could lead to the deployment of compromised EC2 instances, which might be exploited to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems.

Additionally, external AMIs may not comply with your organizationâ€™s security and compliance standards, increasing the risk of non-compliance with regulations and industry best practices. This could result in weakened defenses against attacks, exposure to malware, or unintended operational disruptions due to unverified software or settings within the AMI.
