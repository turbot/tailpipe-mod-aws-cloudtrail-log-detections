## Overview

Detect when the S3 logging bucket associated with an AWS CloudTrail trail is modified. Changes to the logging bucket configuration can disrupt log delivery, expose sensitive log data, or create gaps in security monitoring. Monitoring these modifications ensures the integrity, availability, and security of CloudTrail logs.
