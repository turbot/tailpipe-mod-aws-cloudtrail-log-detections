## Overview

Detect when a VPC flow log was deleted in an AWS account. Deleting flow logs reduces visibility into network traffic, making it harder to detect suspicious activity, troubleshoot issues, and maintain compliance. Monitoring flow log deletions ensures network visibility and supports incident detection and response.
