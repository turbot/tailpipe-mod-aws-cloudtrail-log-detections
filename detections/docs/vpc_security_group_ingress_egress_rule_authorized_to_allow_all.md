## Overview

Detect when a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) security group rule was modified to allow unrestricted traffic to or from 0.0.0.0/0 (IPv4) or ::/0 (IPv6). Allowing unrestricted access exposes resources to the internet, increasing the risk of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or exploitation by attackers. Misconfigured or overly permissive security group rules are a common cause of data breaches and security incidents in cloud environments.
