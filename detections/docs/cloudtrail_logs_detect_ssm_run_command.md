# Overview

AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Run Command allows administrators to execute commands on EC2 instances without the need for SSH access. Monitoring the execution of commands via SSM Run Command is critical to detect unauthorized activities, which may indicate malicious intent or policy violations. Attackers often exploit SSM to execute scripts or commands that compromise security, bypass traditional access controls, or establish persistence.

## Potential Impact of Unmonitored SSM Run Command Executions

Failing to monitor SSM Run Command activities can expose your environment to:

1. **Unauthorized Access:**  
   - Attackers or malicious insiders could use SSM Run Command to execute commands on EC2 instances, bypassing conventional access methods like SSH or RDP.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**  
   - Misuse of SSM Run Command with elevated privileges can lead to unauthorized changes or configuration updates that compromise your environment.

3. **Data Exfiltration or Destruction:**  
   - Commands executed via SSM could allow attackers to exfiltrate sensitive data, delete critical resources, or disrupt services.

4. **Compliance Violations:**  
   - Unmonitored command execution may result in non-compliance with regulatory frameworks that require tracking and auditing of administrative activities.

5. **Delayed Incident Response:**  
   - Without proper monitoring, detecting and responding to unauthorized commands is delayed, increasing the risk of prolonged damage.
