# Overview

AWS EC2 Security Groups control inbound and outbound traffic to your EC2 instances. Monitoring changes to these rules is critical to detect and prevent unauthorized access to your VPC or the potential export of sensitive data. Unauthorized changes to ingress and egress rules can be a sign of malicious activity or misconfiguration that could expose your environment to threats.

## Why is this Detection Necessary?

Security group rules define your network boundaries, and unauthorized changes can lead to significant risks:
1. **Preventing Unauthorized Access**: Detecting changes to ingress and egress rules helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources or data exfiltration.
2. **Early Warning for Exploitation**: Unauthorized modifications, such as adding an ingress rule for lateral movement or an egress rule for data exfiltration, provide early warning signs of exploitation attempts or network abuse.
3. **Enforcing Security Best Practices**: AWS Security Best Practices recommend strict control and monitoring of security group configurations to ensure alignment with organizational security policies.
4. **Improving Incident Response**: Monitoring security group rule changes aids in forensic investigations by highlighting when and how network boundaries were altered during a security incident.

This detection helps organizations maintain secure network boundaries, respond swiftly to suspicious activity, and ensure compliance with regulatory standards.
