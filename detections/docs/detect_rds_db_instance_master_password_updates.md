## Description

This detection identifies updates to the master password for Amazon RDS database instances. The master password is used to authenticate administrative access to the database. Monitoring changes to the master password is essential to ensure the security and integrity of the database.

## Risks

Updating the master password for an RDS instance without proper oversight can lead to operational disruptions, especially if applications or services relying on the database are not updated with the new credentials. Unauthorized or malicious updates to the master password may indicate an attempt to gain administrative control over the database or disrupt access.

Failing to monitor master password changes could also result in non-compliance with security policies that mandate auditing and tracking access credentials. Regularly monitoring and securing master password updates helps maintain the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the database.
