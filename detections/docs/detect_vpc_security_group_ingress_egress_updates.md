## Overview

Detect updates to ingress or egress rules in security groups within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in an AWS account. Changes to security group rules can impact network security, potentially exposing resources to unauthorized access or disrupting legitimate communication. Monitoring these updates helps ensure the security and availability of your resources.
