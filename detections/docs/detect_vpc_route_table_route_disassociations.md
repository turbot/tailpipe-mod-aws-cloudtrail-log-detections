## Overview

Detect dissociations of routes from route tables within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in an AWS account. Disassociating a route can disrupt traffic flow, leading to communication failures and potential application downtime. This may indicate unauthorized changes, misconfigurations, or malicious activity affecting network stability.
