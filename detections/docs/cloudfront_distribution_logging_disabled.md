## Overview

Detect when a CloudFront distribution's logging was disabled. Disabling logging reduces visibility into access and usage, making it difficult to monitor traffic, detect anomalies, or respond to security incidents. Enabling logging ensures access monitoring, supports compliance requirements, and provides valuable insights for troubleshooting and optimization.
