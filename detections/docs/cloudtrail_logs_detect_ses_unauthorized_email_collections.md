# Overview

Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) is a scalable and cost-effective email platform. Monitoring activities related to email collection, such as unauthorized attempts to read, send, or verify email identities, is critical to prevent potential misuse or data breaches. Unauthorized activities via AWS SES could expose sensitive information, facilitate phishing attacks, or disrupt legitimate email workflows.

## Potential Impact of Unmonitored SES Activities

Failing to monitor unauthorized email collection attempts through AWS SES can expose your environment to:

1. **Sensitive Data Exposure:**  
   - Unauthorized access to emails can result in the leakage of sensitive or confidential information, compromising organizational or customer privacy.

2. **Phishing and Fraudulent Activity:**  
   - Unauthorized use of verified email identities could facilitate phishing attacks, tarnishing your organizationâ€™s reputation and misleading recipients.

3. **Compliance Violations:**  
   - Unauthorized email access or misuse may result in non-compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, or HIPAA, leading to penalties and legal consequences.

4. **Operational Disruptions:**  
   - Deletion of email identities or unauthorized sending of emails could disrupt business communications and cause downtime.

5. **Delayed Detection of Malicious Activity:**  
   - Without monitoring, malicious attempts to misuse SES for email collection or distribution may go undetected, allowing attackers to exploit your email infrastructure further.
