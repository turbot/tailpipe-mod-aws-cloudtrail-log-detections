## Overview

Detect AWS Lambda functions using unencrypted code. Unencrypted code exposes sensitive business logic, secrets, or intellectual property to unauthorized access, increasing the risk of data breaches or malicious activity. Encrypting Lambda code ensures security, compliance, and protection against unauthorized access.
