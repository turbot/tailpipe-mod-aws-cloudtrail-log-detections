## Description

This detection identifies Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) snapshots that are publicly accessible. Publicly accessible snapshots expose sensitive data to unauthorized users, increasing the risk of data breaches and misuse. Monitoring and restricting public access to EBS snapshots is essential for maintaining data security.

## Risks

Granting public access to EBS snapshots can result in sensitive data being exposed to unauthorized individuals or malicious actors. Publicly accessible snapshots can be copied, shared, or analyzed without your knowledge, compromising the confidentiality and integrity of your data.

In addition, public snapshots may lead to non-compliance with regulatory frameworks and organizational policies. Standards such as PCI DSS, GDPR, and HIPAA require strict controls over sensitive data, and exposing snapshots publicly can result in legal and financial penalties. Ensuring that EBS snapshots are private or shared only with trusted accounts is critical for maintaining a secure and compliant environment.
