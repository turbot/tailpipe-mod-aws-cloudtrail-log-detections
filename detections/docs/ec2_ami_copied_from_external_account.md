## Overview

Detect when an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) was copied from an external account into your AWS environment. External AMIs may contain vulnerabilities, malicious software, or misconfigurations that could compromise your infrastructure. Monitoring these activities ensures that only trusted and secure AMIs are introduced into your environment.
