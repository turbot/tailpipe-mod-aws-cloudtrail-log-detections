## Description

This detection identifies Amazon Route 53 hosted zones that are associated with Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). Associating a hosted zone with a VPC allows DNS queries to be resolved within the VPC, enabling private DNS functionality. Monitoring these associations is essential to ensure they align with security and operational requirements.

## Risks

Improper or unauthorized associations between hosted zones and VPCs can lead to potential risks such as exposure of internal DNS records to unintended environments or disruptions in DNS resolution for critical services. Overly permissive associations might also allow unauthorized VPCs to query sensitive DNS records, increasing the attack surface.

Monitoring VPC associations with hosted zones ensures that private DNS functionality is correctly configured, adheres to security best practices, and meets organizational requirements for access control and resource isolation.
