## Overview

Detect when public access was granted to an S3 bucket by modifying its policy. Public access to S3 buckets exposes sensitive data to unauthorized users, increasing the risk of data breaches or misuse. Restricting public access ensures data confidentiality and integrity while maintaining compliance with security best practices.
