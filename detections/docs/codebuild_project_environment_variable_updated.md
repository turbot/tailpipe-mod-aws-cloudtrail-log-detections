## Overview

Detect when an environment variable in an AWS CodeBuild project was updated. Unauthorized or unintended changes to environment variables can compromise build integrity, expose sensitive data, or disrupt the build pipeline. Monitoring these updates ensures the security of the build process and safeguards critical resources.
