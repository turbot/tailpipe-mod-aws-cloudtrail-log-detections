## Overview

Detect when the AWS Management Console was accessed by the root user. Root user activity poses significant risks due to its unrestricted administrative privileges, and unnecessary logins may indicate potential misuse or compromised credentials. Ensuring the root account is only used in critical situations helps protect your AWS environment from unauthorized access and enhances security posture.
