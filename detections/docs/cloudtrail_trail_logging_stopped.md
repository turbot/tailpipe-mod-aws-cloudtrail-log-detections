## Overview

Detect when logging was stopped for an AWS CloudTrail trail. Disabling logging creates gaps in security monitoring and audit trails, increasing the risk of undetected malicious activity, such as unauthorized access or data exfiltration. Monitoring logging status ensures continuous visibility into account activity and supports incident response and compliance efforts.
