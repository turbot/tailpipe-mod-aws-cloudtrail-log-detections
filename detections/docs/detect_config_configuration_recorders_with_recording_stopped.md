## Overview

Detect AWS Config configuration recorders that have stopped recording. When recording is stopped, resource configuration changes are no longer captured, creating gaps in monitoring and compliance enforcement. Monitoring the recording status ensures continuous tracking of configuration changes and adherence to defined policies.
