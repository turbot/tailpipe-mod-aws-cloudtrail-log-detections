## Overview

Detect when a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) was deleted in an AWS account. Unauthorized or unplanned VPC deletions can result in the loss of critical resources, disrupt services, and compromise network architecture. Monitoring VPC deletions ensures operational continuity and protects against potential mismanagement or malicious activity.
