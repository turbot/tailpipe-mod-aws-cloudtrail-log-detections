## Overview

Detect when an Amazon S3 bucket was deleted. Bucket deletions can lead to permanent data loss, operational disruptions, or compliance violations, especially if the data is not backed up or the deletion is unauthorized. Ensuring buckets are deleted only by authorized actions helps protect critical data and maintain compliance.
