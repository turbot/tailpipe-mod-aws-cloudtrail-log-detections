## Description

This detection identifies updates to the actions associated with Amazon CloudWatch alarms. Alarm actions define what happens when an alarm changes state (e.g., sending notifications, triggering AWS Lambda functions, or stopping EC2 instances). Unauthorized or unintended updates to alarm actions can disrupt automated responses and compromise security or operational workflows.

## Risks

Modifying CloudWatch alarm actions without proper authorization can result in critical operational or security workflows being disrupted. For example, removing or altering actions may prevent notifications from being sent, automated recovery actions from executing, or security measures from being triggered during an incident.

Unauthorized changes to alarm actions may also indicate malicious activity. An attacker could modify actions to suppress notifications or disable security responses, allowing unauthorized activities to go unnoticed. Monitoring updates to alarm actions ensures the integrity of automated workflows and helps maintain a secure and reliable environment.
