## Overview

Detect instances where Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) feedback forwarding is disabled. Feedback forwarding ensures that bounce and complaint notifications are sent to the email sender, which is critical for monitoring email deliverability and managing sender reputation. Disabling this feature may result in undetected email delivery issues or compromised email sending practices.
