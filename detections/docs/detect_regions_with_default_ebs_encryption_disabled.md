## Description

This detection identifies AWS regions where the default encryption setting for Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes is disabled. By default, EBS volumes should be encrypted to ensure that data at rest is protected. Disabling default encryption may lead to unencrypted volumes being created inadvertently, increasing the risk of data exposure.

## Risks

Failing to enable default EBS encryption introduces significant security and compliance risks. Unencrypted EBS volumes can store sensitive data in plaintext, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access if the volume is compromised. This is particularly concerning in environments that handle sensitive workloads, such as personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, or proprietary business information.

In addition to security concerns, leaving default EBS encryption disabled can result in non-compliance with regulatory requirements or industry standards, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS. Organizations may face financial penalties or reputational damage if data is mishandled or exposed due to insufficient encryption practices.
