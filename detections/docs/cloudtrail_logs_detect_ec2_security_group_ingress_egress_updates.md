# Overview

AWS EC2 Security Groups control inbound and outbound traffic to your EC2 instances. Monitoring changes to these rules is critical to detect and prevent unauthorized access to your VPC or the potential export of sensitive data. Unauthorized changes to ingress and egress rules can be a sign of malicious activity or misconfiguration that could expose your environment to threats.

## Potential Impact of Unmonitored Security Group Changes

Failing to monitor EC2 Security Group changes can expose your environment to:

1. **External Threats:** 
   - Unauthorized ingress rules may allow attackers to exploit open ports, enabling lateral movement or establishing persistence for malicious activities.

2. **Data Exfiltration:** 
   - Unmonitored egress rule modifications can allow sensitive data to be sent to unauthorized destinations, compromising confidentiality and breaching regulatory requirements.

3. **Operational Downtime:** 
   - Security group misconfigurations can disrupt critical applications by blocking legitimate traffic or exposing resources to attacks, causing costly downtime.

4. **Regulatory Non-Compliance:** 
   - Unchecked changes may lead to non-compliance with security and privacy standards (e.g., PCI DSS, SOC 2, GDPR), resulting in penalties or reputational damage.

5. **Delayed Threat Detection:** 
   - Without visibility into security group changes, malicious activity from compromised IAM users or external attackers can go unnoticed, delaying incident response.
