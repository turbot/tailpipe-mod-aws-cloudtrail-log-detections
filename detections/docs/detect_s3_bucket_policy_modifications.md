Detect modifications to Amazon S3 bucket policies, which define access permissions for resources within a bucket. Changes to bucket policies can introduce security risks, such as unauthorized access or overly permissive permissions, leading to potential data breaches. Reviewing these modifications ensures that access controls align with security best practices and compliance requirements.
