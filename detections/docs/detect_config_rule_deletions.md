## Overview

Detect instances where AWS Config rules are deleted. Deleting Config rules disrupts compliance monitoring, potentially leaving non-compliant resources undetected and increasing security and operational risks. Monitoring rule deletions ensures continuous evaluation of resource compliance and maintains a secure cloud environment.
