## Description

This detection identifies the deletion of VPC peering connections in an AWS account. VPC peering connections allow secure communication between VPCs. Deleting a peering connection can disrupt network connectivity and may indicate misconfigurations or unauthorized changes.

## Risks

Deleting a VPC peering connection can result in communication breakdowns between interconnected VPCs, potentially disrupting applications and workflows that depend on this connectivity. This can particularly impact distributed systems, cross-region setups, or hybrid cloud architectures.

In addition, peering connection deletions may indicate unauthorized or malicious activity. An attacker with access to the account could delete a peering connection to isolate a VPC or disrupt services. Without proper monitoring and auditing, such actions could go undetected, compromising the operational integrity of your environment.
