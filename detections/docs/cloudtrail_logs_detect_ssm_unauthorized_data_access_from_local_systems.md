# Overview

AWS Systems Manager (SSM) provides capabilities to manage and operate systems securely. However, unauthorized access to local system data using SSM commands poses significant risks. Monitoring for attempts to collect data from local systems, such as accessing files or configurations via shell commands, is critical to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access.

## Potential Impact of Unmonitored Data Access from Local Systems

Failing to monitor attempts to access local system data using AWS SSM can expose your environment to:

1. **Data Breaches:**  
   - Unauthorized access to local system files or configurations can expose sensitive information, including intellectual property, credentials, or personal data.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**  
   - Attackers can leverage data access attempts to gain insights into system configurations, enabling privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network.

3. **Compliance Violations:**  
   - Unmonitored data access may violate regulatory frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS, leading to penalties and reputational damage.

4. **Operational Disruptions:**  
   - Unauthorized scripts or commands executed on local systems may alter or corrupt critical files, disrupting services and workflows.

5. **Persistent Threats:**  
   - Attackers can collect sensitive data over time, maintaining a stealthy foothold in the environment and evading detection.
