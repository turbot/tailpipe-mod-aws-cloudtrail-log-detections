## Overview

Detect when a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network ACL (NACL) rule was updated to allow public access. NACLs are a critical component of VPC security, controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level. Granting public access to a NACL exposes resources to unauthorized traffic and increases the risk of security breaches.
