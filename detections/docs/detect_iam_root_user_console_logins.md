## Overview

Detect AWS Management Console login events by the root user. Root user activity is inherently high-risk due to its unrestricted administrative access, and unnecessary logins may indicate potential misuse or compromised credentials. Monitoring these events helps ensure that the root account is only used in critical situations and aids in identifying unauthorized access to your AWS environment.
