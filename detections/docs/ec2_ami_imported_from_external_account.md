## Overview

Detect when an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) was imported from an external source into your AWS environment. External AMIs may introduce vulnerabilities, malicious code, or misconfigurations that could compromise the security of your infrastructure. Monitoring imports ensures that only trusted and validated AMIs are utilized.
