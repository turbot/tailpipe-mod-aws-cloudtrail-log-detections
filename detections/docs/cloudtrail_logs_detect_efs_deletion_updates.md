# Overview

Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) provides scalable, cloud-native file storage for applications. Monitoring deletion events for EFS file systems, mount targets, and related resources is essential to detect unauthorized changes, potential disruptions, or malicious activities. Unauthorized deletions can result in data loss, application downtime, or compliance violations.

## Potential Impact of Unmonitored EFS Deletion Events

Failing to monitor EFS deletion events can expose your environment to:

1. **Data Loss:** 
   - Unauthorized deletions of file systems or files can lead to irreversible loss of critical business data, impacting operations and productivity.

2. **Service Disruption:** 
   - Deleting mount targets or security group configurations can disrupt application workflows, causing downtime and impacting end-user experience.

3. **Compliance Violations:** 
   - Unmonitored deletions may result in non-compliance with data retention and recovery policies mandated by regulatory standards such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, or GDPR.

4. **Delayed Incident Response:** 
   - Without visibility into deletion events, identifying and addressing malicious activity or accidental changes can be delayed, increasing the damage caused.

5. **Exploitation Opportunities:** 
   - Attackers could leverage deletions to disrupt services, hide tracks, or remove access controls, creating opportunities for further exploitation.
