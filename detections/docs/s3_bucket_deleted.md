## Overview

Detect instances where Amazon S3 buckets are deleted. Bucket deletions can lead to permanent data loss, operational disruptions, or compliance violations, especially if the data is not backed up or the deletion is unauthorized. Identifying these events ensures that critical data remains protected and only authorized deletions occur.
