## Overview

Detect when a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) was created in an AWS account. Unauthorized or misconfigured VPCs can introduce security vulnerabilities, such as misconfigured network controls or unmonitored gateways, and lead to operational challenges like resource sprawl or routing conflicts. Monitoring VPC creation ensures adherence to security and compliance requirements.
