## Overview

Detect Amazon CloudFront distributions with geo-restriction disabled. Disabling geo-restriction may lead to content being accessible in regions with compliance, licensing, or security restrictions, increasing the risk of misuse or piracy. Ensuring geo-restriction is properly configured helps align content delivery with business and regulatory requirements.
