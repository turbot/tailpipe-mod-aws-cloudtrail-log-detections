# Overview

AWS Systems Manager (SSM) enables secure and auditable management of EC2 instances and other AWS resources. Monitoring for unauthorized input capture, such as keyboard input logging through SSM sessions, is crucial to prevent potential breaches or misuse. Attackers may exploit SSM capabilities, like port forwarding sessions, to capture sensitive input or credentials without being detected.

## Potential Impact of Unmonitored Input Capture Activities

Failing to monitor unauthorized input capture via AWS SSM can expose your environment to:

1. **Credential Theft:**  
   - Input capture may lead to unauthorized access to sensitive credentials or authentication tokens, enabling further exploitation of your environment.

2. **Data Breaches:**  
   - Unauthorized logging of keyboard inputs could expose sensitive information, such as private keys, passwords, or proprietary data.

3. **Regulatory Violations:**  
   - Unmonitored input capture may violate compliance standards like GDPR, PCI DSS, or HIPAA, which require safeguards against unauthorized data logging.

4. **Persistent Threats:**  
   - Attackers using input capture techniques may establish a foothold in your environment, allowing them to monitor activities and exfiltrate information over time.

5. **Delayed Threat Detection:**  
   - Without monitoring, unauthorized input capture may go unnoticed, leading to prolonged exposure and greater impact.
