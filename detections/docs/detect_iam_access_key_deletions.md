## Description

This detection identifies the deletion of IAM access keys. Access keys are used for programmatic access to AWS resources, and their deletion could indicate routine key rotation or unauthorized activity. Monitoring access key deletions helps ensure compliance with security best practices and detect potential malicious actions.

## Risks

The deletion of IAM access keys can have both operational and security implications. If keys are deleted unintentionally or without proper coordination, it may disrupt applications or services that rely on the keys for authentication, leading to downtime or operational failures. 

From a security perspective, unauthorized deletion of access keys could be an attempt to disrupt detection mechanisms or conceal malicious activity by invalidating previously compromised keys. Monitoring access key deletions helps ensure key management practices are properly followed and provides visibility into potential security incidents.
