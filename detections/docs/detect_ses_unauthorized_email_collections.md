## Overview

Detect unauthorized attempts to collect emails using Amazon Simple Email Service (SES). Activities such as unauthorized access to email content, misuse of verified identities, or attempts to send unsolicited emails can expose sensitive information, facilitate phishing, or disrupt legitimate workflows. Monitoring these activities ensures the security of your SES resources and prevents misuse.
