Detect the upload of tool-related files, such as scripts, executables, or software packages, to Amazon S3 buckets. These uploads could indicate routine operations, such as application deployments, or unauthorized activities, such as the introduction of malicious tools. Identifying such uploads ensures compliance with security policies and mitigates potential risks.
