## Overview

Detect when a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) security group was deleted. Security groups are essential for controlling traffic to resources, and their deletion can disrupt access control or expose resources to unauthorized traffic. Monitoring these events helps ensure proper oversight and prevents potential security or operational issues.
